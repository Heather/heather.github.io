title: Freedom of speech and Privacy
---

Motivation
==========

People write about privacy, I feel like I should not mention those posts here. Spyware, ads, privacy tools, safe social media portals... Reading about that makes me feel just sad and it's not easy to explain why in simple reply.
Reasons to care are always alike that: [6 Reasons To Care About Online Privacy Even If You've Got Nothing To Hide](https://www.buzzfeed.com/AnotherThoughtMachine/6-reasons-to-care-about-online-privacy-even-if-you-23uh1)
And methods to fight are always random: [6 REALLY PRACTICAL WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR PRIVACY ONLINE](https://www.amnesty.org.au/6-really-practical-ways-to-protect-your-privacy-online/).

Reality
=======

My reason to care about privacy is some kind of freedom. Freedom of being yourself without having problems with governemnt or stigmatic people or (with any random reason) society or even your very close friends. Yes, absolute freedom is equal to death and that's not what I meant, I want "just some more freedom". And I state that my reason is different from what people usually care about talking about privacy, there are some connections or sometimes it's one of good points there but it's nearly never the only goal and it's totally have never been reached (specially by suggested methods). Freedom can be important aspect of motivation and emotional energy, many people don't take such aspects seriously and for some people "ego" is not imporant, just business. I can understand that and deal with that, even for communication I can sacrifice decent privacy. That's just sad and boring.

We Live In a Society
====================

Even if having good privacy on internet is possible you hardly can hide your job from your coworkers and your name from your mother. And if you think that hiding your job is stupid think about world’s oldest profession for example. It's privat information and people tend to hide it. People want to have good privacy outside internet too however sometimes you can hide your name working as slut but you often can't hide your name contributing to most of Open Source projects (a lot of them). You can have ability to use ungoogled chromium or to build kernel without blobs, people focus on mysterious or really less important privacy problems. [FSF](https://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Copyright-Papers.html) or GuixSD copyright policy allows using pseudonyms but they still will use legal name for government issued documents. So that's what I want "just some more freedom".

Social media
============

Term "just some more freedom" could be used to social media too. For example you can't have total privacy on GNU Social or mastodon (your public account is still being yours, in terms of serivce you can read that you still take responsibility for your words) but at least those don't hold gun close to your butt and your phone number. You can't trust discord and you must understand that all the things you tell on Freenode IRC could be public and you will need to take responsibility either. Sure you should be careful with your words but at least you won't be arrested for repost alike on vk or fb (so far).

And I'm using mastodon but if I will share my account there I will lose privacy I want so I'm happy there with two posts and 0 followers, maybe later I will give it more attention but I just don't have time for it. Decent privacy is hard to build and easy to break thing and if you go for it you must be ready to pay for it (and maybe break some laws).

Tools
=====

I'd suggest using whatever social network you want. You can use twitter or facebook, well, using fake name on facebook is not legal by their terms and you will get additional punishment if you will be catched for that. What you really need (WARNING: it's most likely not legal and you may have problems for it) is phone which was not bought by you or anyone who knows you, you will need phone number/sim card with same aspects, you will need to pay for that number in different terminals wearing full face helms and sure gloves, you will need using differe wifi cafes (using same helms) when you login and... I better will not write about that in details because if you've got whole idea you will find what you need by yourself.

Conclusion
==========

Early I used ot care about it too much but one of my friends changed my mind. He used to repeat "nobody cares" in various situations, everytime when I was speaking with him he used to repeat "nobody cares" and those words are healing for people alike me, he had changed my mind a lot. Maybe those words was most helpful words in my live which could sound strange but they are important. Remember to repeat such words if you have paranoid friends. In the same time if you are in power to be able to change or affect restriction policy - try it because it could help many people and eventually those people will thank you back.
