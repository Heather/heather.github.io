I'm working for ~4-5 years as developer in the same organization which is working with oil and gas metrology 
and it's my first serious job. I am developer so I work with DBMS (we mostly use MS SQL Server there), write software 
on server side, front-end and cross-compiling code for controllers either.

Most of "hobby projects" and OSS contributions are available on GitHub but there is no something very attractive so far.
