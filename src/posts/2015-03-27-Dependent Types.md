title: Selling dependent types

There was long standing question on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lenadroid/status/577058060860071937)

practical application/use cases of dependently typed programming languages?

Great answer from Chris Allen:

> That sucks and means there's a bunch of things you're not allowed to do. There's a phase separation between types and values. <br/>
> in Idris, types and values can hop back and forth interchangeably, almost kinda like if you had reflection, except it's type-safe and used to create types that very precisely circumscribe what you want. <br/>

Answer from Brian McKenna:

I was asked to post my simple explanation so here is it...

For example everybody knows about generics and why and where they are useful and we call it alike `foo<Type>()`, now imagine we have some function which does something and returns Type based on integer, for example 4 -> Int, 2 -> Short, 8 -> Long, etc...  So we can `foo<bar(i)>()` so in this case you will not create additional case type-binder... e.g. you still write that 4 will be Int but you don't write that 4 will be foo<int> ... that looks like small metaprogramming trick but when it's all over the code it's not bad, e.g. better readability and more available programming tactics for logics implementation, faster solution solving

Let take a look to example on [rust-lang.org](http://www.rust-lang.org)

``` cpp
let program = "+ + * - /";
let mut accumulator = 0;

for token in program.chars() {
    match token {
        '+' => accumulator += 1,
        '-' => accumulator -= 1,
        '*' => accumulator *= 2,
        '/' => accumulator /= 2,
        _ => { /* ignore everything else */ }
    }
}
```

Press `Run` on website

Not sure if you guess or not but result is 1, because it's integer...

How we can handle it with Idris?

``` haskell
main : IO ()
main = putStrLn $ "The program "
                    ⧺ prog
                    ⧺ " calculates the value "
                    ⧺ (show $ acc (unpack prog) 0)
 where aType : Type
       aType = if ('/' ∈ (unpack prog))
                    then Float
                    else Int

       acc : (List Char) → aType → aType
       acc [] m = m
       acc (x::xs) m = acc xs $ case x of
                                 '+' => m + 1
                                 '-' => m - 1
                                 '*' => m ⋅ 2
                                 '/' => m ÷ 2
                                 _   => m
```

``` shell
The program + + * - / calculates the value 1.5
```

Discover the difference... But it's small case. With thinking about types we can resolve a lot of common problems much faster. One of the great examples will be type providers in Idris [github](https://github.com/david-christiansen/idris-type-providers) [pdf](http://itu.dk/people/drc/pubs/dependent-type-providers.pdf) by David Christiansen
