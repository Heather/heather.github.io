title: Everything about genders
---

In short, everything you should know about genders is Nothing

TLDR

I'm writing this post because I'm tired of people talking about genders (generally) but also about other many different aspects...
Mostly I've being catched as just troll but it's often just complicated to explain my position so this post is the answer.
I want to explain my position to people with obsession to ther genders and people who Fight for Equality.
I don't want to write anything about sexist, racist, homophobic people, those words are meaningless.
And I don't even want to point people who turn their position into pure hate, hate to men, hate to white people, etc.
Sure you can be anyone: Spiderman, Woman, Jesus Christ and I don't want to argue with that but...

 - I don't want to be in your fight and protect you being different - I have own reasons to blame people
 - I don't want to be in your community of being different - It's just a fake church
 - I don't want to hear of your pain being female, transwoman, black, whatever - I will ignore it, I promise
 - I don't want to know the way I should talk about you `he/she/they/it` it's up to me, whether you're stright male I can use `she` - yes I can
 - I don't want to apply any of those fighter terms or genders or orientation to myself - I'm fine being just myself
 - I don't want to know terms for either your gender identify, gender expression, sexual orientation - I'm fine with you being yourself

If this is not something you can accept - I'm sorry. Maybe you will just hate me, ignore me (sure I don't understand)

However if you can accept that position then we're done in making step forward into some different level of common sense.
There are a lot of people who don't accept difference but from my position those people don't accept just you (being yourself ("beign yourself")).
84% of the world's population is affiliated with one of the five largest religions and almost 100% is affiliated with some gender.

I don't care.
